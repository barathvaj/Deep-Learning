# Deep-Learning Coding Challenge

Objective here is to explore the concepts of deep learning and implementing it from scratch in a structured way. We will test the network with our default handwritten dataset.


## Session 1 : Building Layer based API for builiding and extending neural network
 
**About** : In this part of this exercise, we will create a Layer and Sequential API for building neural network at ease. We will also implement SGD with momentum and popular activation functions

## Session 2 - Types of Optimizers and its implementation

**About** : In this exercise, we will try to explore different optimizers, extend those and implement it as part of the Layered API and we also test those with our default dataset

## Session 3 -  DropOut 

**About** : In this session, we will discuss dropout in detail and compare it with ensemble or bagging techniques. Extend Dropout as part of Layered API.
